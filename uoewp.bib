	abstract = {Wildfires are increasing in severity and frequency in the American West, but there is limited understanding of their economic effects at the community level. We conducted a case study of the impacts of large wildfires in 2008 in Trinity County, California, by examining labor market, suppression spending, and qualitative interview data. We found that the 2008 fires had interrelated effects on several economic sectors in the county. Labor market data indicated a decrease in total private-sector employment and wages and an increase in public-sector employment and wages during the summer of 2008 compared to the previous year, while interviews captured more nuanced impacts for individual businesses.},

	abstract = {Payments for ecosystem or ecological services (PES) are voluntary, often market-based approaches to protecting environmental values. In the rural United States, some landowners receive PES through government led conservation programs, but little is known about their involvement in market based arrangements. We analyzed three examples of market based PES arrangements in northwestern Montana: watershed restoration and craft brewing, niche meat production, and certified timber supplies. We find that intermediaries were working between buyers and sellers in each case to set conditions for transactions and undertake the mechanics of implementation. These findings align with existing conceptualizations of intermediaries as crucial links in PES arrangements, but also suggest that intermediaries for market based PES arrangements are not always facilitators or neutral nongovernmental actors; they may actually be from the private sector and drive the process by serving as buyers. This research contributes to stronger understanding of the possibilities for local market based conservation in the rural West.},

The creation and endurance of governance institutions capable of implementing sustainability policies is, in fact, fundamental for any viable conception of sustainable development. The analyses focus not only on how societies can organize, but on how they do organize to overcome such daunting obstacles in the Netherlands, the Northwest United States, Costa Rica, Madagascar, Senegal, and the European Union. The writers focus particularly upon the special problem embedded in the sustainability paradigm, that of organizing governance across scales―that is to say, across and between geographic, political, ecological, or other social levels in a sustainable regime. In recent years the scale problem has emerged as a major and enlarging concern, as international efforts proliferate to implement various sorts of sustainability policies. The analyses focus not only on how societies can organize, but on how they do organize to overcome such daunting obstacles. The analyses place considerable emphasis upon the history and lessons to be learned from ongoing efforts to achieve such governance in several diverse international settings including the Netherlands, the Northwest United States, Costa Rica, Madagascar, Senegal, and the European Union.},

	abstract = {In contrast to traditional structures of state-centric bureaucratic administration, hybrid networks of state and non-state actors are believed to possess the advantages of greater adaptability in the face of environmental change as well as greater legitimacy in contested socio-political settings. Between 1998 and 2016, pine forests throughout the western United States experienced the largest and most destructive outbreak of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) on record, with most of the affected forests located on lands owned and managed by the U.S. government as national forests. Socio-political responses to this event in many geographies included the emergence of local to regional hybrid networks that provided direction and resources for responding to the disturbance event. In this study, we analyze the ability of governance networks to adapt in the face of the insect outbreak across four regional geographies: The Black Hills region of South Dakota and Wyoming; northern Colorado; northeastern Washington; and southwestern Montana. Specifically, we ask what factors accounted for divergent governance responses in the four cases and to what extent the emergent governance dynamics in each case facilitated lasting, long-term adaptation. Our results highlight governance trajectories as products of their respective histories and of feedback cycles among socio-political, institutional, and technological variables. By analyzing the origin, characteristics, and persistence of institutional change, this research contributes a comparative perspective on the adaptive potential of networks as functions of influences from multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

Here we report on an effort to develop a suite of indicators designed to capture some of the most tangible elements of a transition from dominant federal to social forestry modes of governance. We pilot test these data on the Willamette National Forest using data from a variety of sources internal and external to the USDA Forest Service.

Despite its implied reconciliation of commodity production and environmental protection, this concept remains contested terrain, masking tensions over land use practices and understandings of human–nature relations. Here we draw on a case study of landownership and land use change in remote, rural Wallowa County, Oregon to explore how working landscapes are envisioned and enacted by various actors. The arrival of landowning amenity migrants, many of whom actively endorsed a working landscape vision, resulted in subtle but significant transformations in land use practices and altered opportunities for local producers. The working landscape ideal, while replete with tensions and contradictions, nevertheless functioned as an important alternative vision to the rural gentrification characteristic of other scenic Western environs.},

This report offers four strategies for collaboration based on the experiences of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Both agencies have authorities, called “stewardship contracting,” which they used to foster collaboration at the front line in their agencies. Although stewardship contracting is a set of authorities particular to the U.S. Forest Service and BLM, much of the collaboration that these two agencies have undertaken around stewardship contracting did not require any special authority. The two agencies have used stewardship contracting as a vehicle to develop a new direction and support for collaborative approaches to federal land management.},

However, appropriations for hazardous fuels reduction still lag behind wildfire suppression spending. Offsetting fuels treatment costs through biomass utilization or by using innovative administrative mechanisms such as stewardship contracting are two approaches to stretching appropriated dollars further across the landscape. We use fuels treatment data (n = 8,451 locations) to ask how wood- processing infrastructure influences where and how much hazardous fuels treatments, biomass utilization, and stewardship contracting occur on national forests in Oregon and Washington. We found that national forest ranger districts that are relatively close in proximity to sawmills or biomass facilities treated more overall ha and more wildland-urban interface ha and used stewardship contracting on more ha than ranger districts further away and that there was a threshold distance for these effects (40 minutes). We also found that proximity to sawmills and biomass facilities influenced the location and extent of hazardous fuels treatments that incorporated biomass utilization or were administered through a stewardship contract. Our analysis suggests that to be effective at offsetting some of the costs of hazardous fuels reduction and treat a greater extent of the landscape, policy strategies may need to focus on supporting a network of wood-processing facilities that is distributed across forest-based communities.},

This research classifies 370 state policies from across the United States that provides incentives for forest biomass utilization. We compare those policies by types of incentives relative to the supply chain and geographic clustering. We then develop a framework for policy evaluation building on the supply chain steps, which can be used to assess intended and unintended consequences of policy interactions.

	abstract = {The appeal of biomass utilization grows as the need for wildfire risk reduction, economic development, and renewable energy generation becomes more pressing. However, uncertainty exists regarding the factors necessary to stimulate use. We draw on in-depth interviews with local industry, agency, community, and tribal representatives from 10 study sites on federal public lands across the United States to examine persistent conventional wisdoms about what hinders biomass use. Findings indicate that the conventional wisdoms were reasonably accurate although the degree to which each impeded progress varied. Their interconnectedness also varied depending on local conditions. Supply guarantees, industry presence, transportation, and the value of the biomass were limiting factors to use, whereas agency budgets and staffing, environmental concerns, and partnerships more aggravated the problem than impeded progress. Understanding the scope and consistency of these accepted truths is important for ensuring that management efforts and ensuing policy effectively targets local use challenges.},

	abstract = {Three species of small-diameter logs from the Klamath/Siskiyou Mountains and the Cascade Range in southwest Oregon were tested for their potential for value-added structural applications. The logs were tested in bending and compression parallel to the grain. Strength and stiffness values were correlated to possible nondestructive evaluation grading parameters and compared to values derived from published values based on tests of small-diameter clear wood of the test species. For the test sample, specific gravity and static bending modulus of elasticity were good indicators of strength. Growth rate, however, was poorly correlated to specific gravity, strength, and stiffness. The results suggest that the conventionally derived design values based on published small clear strength values are appropriate for bending but nonconservative for axial compressive strength. At present, established round timber specifications, modified to place limits on the presence of crown wood, would be sufficient for selection of small-diameter structural timbers. If a more tightly controlled strength limit is desirable for a specific application, static modulus of elasticity appears to be the most reliable indicator of strength of small-diameter logs.},

This case reflects the complexity of influences on public health beyond conventional perspectives of public health institutions. Our model accounts for a community's external context such as its political, legal, social and environmental influences. This model of public health also represents a community's internal dynamics, including social cohesion, disease and epidemics, and economic vitality. Public health practice that includes external context and internal dynamics will lead to greater levels of participation and empowerment in public health conflicts.},

People agreed on important places and where development should occur-a collective social vision-highlighting the value of expanding social mapping to other counties or statewide. Social maps could be used to inform local planning, such as comprehensive plans, siting new development, and prioritizing locations for future recreation, conservation, and water projects. KEY SURVEY FINDINGS We surveyed residents of Albany, Carbon, and Sweewater counties in 2010. Most participants reported that fish and wildlife habitat, availability of water, and open spaces and scenic views are extremely or very important to them. Water is very important to people for agriculture and recreation. Most participants were very concerned about the possibility of future drought, but very few participants felt that their communities are prepared for future droughts. Many participants perceive that wind energy development may enhance the economic sustainability of family farms and ranches, but there was some concern about the potential negative effects of wind developments on wildlife populations and access to some lands for recreation.},

	abstract = {The scenic rural landscape of Wallowa County, Oregon has attracted attention from
affluent urban populations who value the physical setting and sense of rural
authenticity of this remote setting. Since at least the 1990s, Wallowa County has
experienced a wave of real estate investment by amenity-oriented populations, some
of whom relocated permanently to the county and some of whom visit their
properties only seasonally. Here, we apply the insights of rural gentrification
scholarship to questions of land use and management. Specifically, we draw upon
recent work on actor-oriented gentrification to highlight the ways in which land use
is implicated in the reflexive processes of place (re)creation by gentrifier
populations. In this case, many landowner-gentrifiers were acutely aware of their
potential role in transforming the local landscape in ways which diminish local
authenticity. An emergent discourse of "working lands" served as potential common
ground for the imaginaries of both gentrifier and long-term resident populations. At
the same time, landowner-gentrifiers instituted subtle but significant changes to land
use practices in an attempt to reconcile their interests in consumption and protection
with their interests in maintaining more traditional productivist practices. We
interpret the working lands discourse as a manifestation of Leo Marx\&apos;s concept of
the "middle landscape," situated between the extremes of unpeopled wilderness and
runaway capitalist production.

We found that the effects of declining timber harvests were variable and depended on the importance of the timber sector in a community in the late 1980s, the extent to which federal timber supported that sector, and the degree to which local residents depended on US Forest Service jobs. In addition, we found that other goods, services, and opportunities associated with federal lands declined under the Plan, further affecting communities by curtailing private and public sector business and employment opportunities. Community effects also depended on the unique circumstances of a community. A socioeconomic well-being index we developed indicated that overall, communities within five miles of a federal forest were not doing as well as communities farther away.},

	abstract = {As part of the 10-year socioeconomic monitoring of the Northwest Forest Plan, this report evaluates changes in Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) procurement contracting between 1990 and 2002 by asking, (1) How much and what kind of work did the Forest Service and BLM contract during this period, and (2) who received economic benefits from this procurement contracting? Procurement contracting is a particular focus of the socioeconomic monitoring because one expectation of the Northwest Forest Plan was that the Forest Service and BLM would create high-skill, high-wage private sector jobs in public land restoration through contracting to partially offset job losses in timber production, harvesting, and processing. This report finds that, to the contrary, the Forest Service reduced its contracting of land management activities on national forests in the Northwest Forest Plan area from a high of \$103 million in 1991 to a low of \$33 million in 2002. By contrast, BLM spending was fairly constant at just under \$20 million annually. Both the Forest Service and the BLM changed the type of activities that they contracted, shifting from activities associated with intensive forest management such as tree planting in clearcuts to activities associated with ecosystem management. Contractors located near national forests and BLM lands and rural communities captured a similar proportion of contracts in both the earlier and later parts of the study period. However, the significant decline in Forest Service contract spending resulted in considerable decline in the amount of money flowing to rural communities through contracting. Thus, it is unlikely that federal land management contracting created a net increase in jobs to replace jobs lost in mills and logging operations in public lands communities.},

Our findings are based on quantitative data from the U.S. census, the USDA Forest Service and other federal databases, historical documents, and interviews with Forest Service employees and members of five case study communities: Naches Valley, Cashmere, Entiat, Twisp, and the Upper Okanogan Valley. We explore how the Plan affected the flow of socioeconomic benefits associated with the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, such as the production of forest commodities and forest-based recreation, agency jobs, procurement contract work for ecosystem management activities, grants for community economic assistance, payments to county governments, and opportunities for collaborative forest management. The greatest socioeconomic change stemming from the national forest during the study period was the sharp decline in timber harvest activities, a change that had been underway prior to the Plan. This decline not only affected timber industry jobs in local communities, but also resulted in declining agency budgets and staff reductions. Communities' responses differed. Communities with greater economic diversity were able to absorb the changes in forest management, whereas communities more heavily dependent on timber experienced an additional destabilizing effect.},

	abstract = {This report, examines socioeconoinic changes that took place between 1990 and 2003 on and around lands managed by the Klamatli National Forest in California to assess the effects of the Northwest Forest Plan (the Plan) on rural economies and communities there. Three case communities were studied: Scott Valley, Butte Valley, and Mid-Klamalh. The report characterizes the region and its history, discusses management changes on the forest under the Plan and how they were perceived, describes socioeconomic change in the communities and how they were linked to the Plan, and evaluates how well Plan socioeconomic goals were met by the Klamath National Forest.},

	abstract = {The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 aimed to create jobs and jumpstart the economy while addressing the Nation's social and environmental needs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, received \$1.15 billion in recovery funding to support projects in wildland fire management, capital improvement and maintenance, and biomass utilization. This volume contains eight individual case-study reports that describe how Forest Service economic recovery projects from around the United States are contributing to socioeconomic well-being in rural communities and investigates how forest restoration, conservation, and rural community development goals can be linked to promote healthy forests and healthy communities. Research findings demonstrate that these projects met several goals of the act: (1) preserve and create jobs and stimulate economic recovery; (2) assist those most impacted by the recession; and (3) invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other infrastructure for long-term economic benefits. A companion synthesis report contains key findings and lessons learned by comparing the eight case studies presented here.},

	abstract = {Recent research on environmental conflict in New Mexico has focused on racial and ethnic conflict between environmentalists and Hispanic loggers as a means to explain the trajectory of environmental struggle and the failure of Hispano/environmentalist coalitions opposing Forest Service management policies. This paper seeks to extend this explanation by considering the constraining role of federal legislation, institutional management and commercial resource exploitation that limited opportunities for Hispano/environmental collaborative challenges to federal resource management arrangements. I analyze the foundations of sustained yield forestry on the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico though a focus on the legal construction of sustained yield policies and the practices of implementing sustained yield on the Vallecitos Federal Sustained Yield Unit, a special timber production sub-unit of the Carson. The paper illustrates how the deployment of sustained yield forestry in New Mexico produced not only conditions of production favorable to commercial timber operators, but also established a complex and contradictory regulatory environment that effectively constrained collaborative efforts between environmentalists and small-scale loggers in their efforts to construct alternative futures for resource management in the region. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Payment for forest-based carbon sequestration may be an emerging opportunity to help mitigate climate change while creating new income streams for forest landowners. It is important to understand families' willingness to participate in emerging carbon markets, as they own 35\% of the nation's forestlands. Most family forest owners have not enrolled in forest stewardship programs, suggesting that it may be difficult for them to participate in emerging carbon offset markets. The pilot study reported in this article sought to understand family forest owner willingness to participate in carbon sequestration projects by asking professional foresters who are members of the Forest Guild what they believed would influence family forest owner willingness to participate in sequestration projects and how projects could be designed to foster participation. These foresters identified profitability, compliance difficulties, immaturity of carbon markets, property rights infringements, moral objections to carbon markets, and forester hesitation in recommending participation as the principal barriers to participation. They suggested that barriers could be overcome by increasing profitability, creating low cost and low hassle compliance systems, addressing landowner property rights concerns, and implementing education campaigns aimed at increasing forester knowledge of carbon markets and sequestration projects.},

	abstract = {Rural forest communities in the US Pacific Northwest have seen their economic base disappear with the technological change and reduced timber supply in the forest products industry. Some progress has been made in diversifying local economies, but rural communities are still lagging. Rural communities and workers have a great stake in assuring that future resource jobs provide them with a way to make a living and stay connected to the land base. However, quality jobs providing good compensation, accepted skill standards and career opportunities are not likely to emerge without major intervention and advocacy. This paper examines one attempt to create quality resource jobs in the field of ecosystem management, the Ecosystem Workforce Project (EWP). EWP is a three-year action research project in Western Oregon that provides community-based training in ecosystem management to rural workers. I first explore the multiple obstacles to implementing a quality job path to ecosystem management, including the structure and behavior of the forestry services industry, the policies and organizational culture of the public land management agencies (the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management), and the historic lack of community voice in resource management decisions. I then describe the EWP. And finally I draw lessons from the EWP experience for using community-based workforce development projects as a pathway towards systematic change.},

Yet there have also been collaborative groups established to address large regions and policy-level conflicts. Little is known about how policy-level collaboratives differ from the action-level efforts that dominate the literature. Based on three independent case studies and an international forum involving 17 researchers and practitioners, this article compares the findings from policy-level collaboratives established in Australia and the United States. The authors identify four distinct aspects of policy-level collaboratives, which relate to convening, organizational arrangements, science investment, and implementation strategies. We conclude by suggesting key research questions that need to be pursued to better understand how these groups can more effectively address large bioregions and significant policy problems. © 2011 Crown copyright.},

	abstract = {Globally, ecological restoration activities are increasing in response to environmental, economic, and cultural trends that value ecological capital for the services provided by healthy functioning ecosystems. To ensure continued investment in ecological restoration, practitioners and researchers need to identify links to the benefits accrued to society from ecological restoration practice and policy. Nonetheless, a recent review of published literature on ecological restoration concludes that the policy and socioeconomic contributions of ecological restoration are often ignored. To help fill this gap, we describe the policy context of a sustained program of forest and watershed restoration in Oregon, U.S.A. and report on three related studies on the market structure and resulting economic impacts of this program of work in Oregon. The first study examines the experiences of watershed councils (n = 52) in mobilizing human resources for ecological restoration. The second focuses on the businesses and firms (n = 190) that participate in Oregon's restoration economy. The third analyzes the employment and economic impacts from a sample of Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board restoration grants (n = 99). We found that the sustained program of restoration work in Oregon has conferred significant benefits to Oregon's economy. These impacts largely accrue to rural areas in need of economic development opportunities due to declines in traditional resource management activities. In addition to approximately 16 jobs supported per million dollars invested in ecological restoration, a sustained investment in restoration has created both new local organizational capacity in watershed councils and other community‐based partners and business opportunities especially in rural Oregon.},

These workers and their Anglo counterparts plant and thin trees, perform other forestry services, and fight wildland fires. Poor job quality has been persistent, especially for Latino workers. We compare working conditions between fire suppression and nonsuppression forest work across Latino and non-Latino populations in Oregon. We find that although both groups share some similar conditions, Latino workers often faced poorer conditions, including disrespectful treatment, uncompensated injuries, risk of being blackballed if they complained, and little opportunity for advancement. However, there were some important job quality improvements for Latinos in fire suppression, including compensation for travel and training. Differences in contracting market structure and federal oversight between fire suppression and other forest work may contribute to improved job quality. This suggests the potential for improving conditions by focusing on improving contracting markets and oversight.},

	abstract = {This paper examines micro-processes of institutionalization, using the case of stewardship contracting within the US Forest Service. Our basic premise is that, until a new policy becomes an everyday practice among local actors, it will not become institutionalized at the macro-scale. We find that micro-processes of institutionalization are driven by a mixture of large-scale institutional dynamics and how frontline decision-makers understand and interpret these dynamics, given the local social and ecological context in which they operate. For example, this paper suggests that a new policy may become institutionalized when it is understood to solve problems that old institutions at once create and demand to be solved. Agency actors cannot be conceptualized as untethered from the institutions in which they operate. Yet, within larger institutional dynamics, field personnel make key choices about whether to adopt a new policy, making them important players in the micro-processes of policy institutionalization. The interplay of actors and institutions turns agencies, such as the Forest Service, into complex systems that cannot be understood as artifacts of their own history or as a sum of the decisions of individual actors. This dynamic also implies that macro-level institutional change will be uneven, incomplete, and gradual, mirroring uneven, contingent micro-level processes.},

	abstract = {Payments for ecosystems services (PES) is increasingly recognized as a way to protect and enhance ecosystems by linking beneficiaries and providers through various payment options and voluntary supply arrangements. The concept of the local marketplace, which uses a non-commodity, expanded view of the PES marketplace, has significant potential for non-fungible PES such as watershed services. Water utilities can be key drivers in development of such marketplaces as they are prominent actors in communities and watersheds, and they are typically strategically situated between PES purchasers and potential providers. This article explores the potential for local PES marketplaces and the role of water utilities in their development through a case study of the Voluntary Incentives Program (VIP), a PES initiative under development by the Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB) in Eugene, Oregon. Using a mixed method research approach to explore institutional and social acceptability issues, findings suggest strong support for the program, and for EWEB's role among providers and purchasers. Implications include, among other things, the significant potential for water utilities to act as local marketplace drivers and the importance of carefully designing local PES programs to meet local marketplace needs and support.},

At the urging of citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and industry, government officials at all levels have experimented with collaboration. Yet questions remain about the roles that governments play in collaboration–whether they are constructive and support collaboration, or introduce barriers. This thoughtful book analyzes a series of cases to understand how collaborative processes work and whether government can be an equal partner even as government agencies often formally control decision making and are held accountable for the outcomes. Looking at examples where government has led, encouraged, or followed in collaboration, the authors assess how governmental actors and institutions affected the way issues were defined, the resources available for collaboration, and the organizational processes and structures that were established. Cases include collaborative efforts to manage watersheds, rivers, estuaries, farmland, endangered species habitats, and forests. The authors develop a new theoretical framework and demonstrate that government left a heavy imprint in each of the efforts. The work concludes by discussing the choices and challenges faced by governmental institutions and actors as they try to realize the potential of collaborative environmental management. © 2004 by Resources for the Future.

Factor analysis and multiple regression techniques revealed the most important variables that influence those beliefs. Overall, respondents believed that the socioeconomic outcomes were negative and the ecological outcomes were neutral or slightly positive. Respondents with more conservative political attitudes who owned larger properties were more likely to believe that the outcomes would be negative. As the importance of maintaining property for future generations and increasing timber productivity increased, respondents believed the potential outcomes would be increasingly negative. As the importance of improving water quality, increasing carbon storage, and improving recreational use on the property increased, respondents believed that the outcomes would be increasingly positive.

We interviewed individuals in the partnerships, with MSA ideas of how solutions to policy problems develop, and the role of policy entrepreneurs. We found that wildfires served as focusing events, creating space and time for learning, collaboration and new problem framing, increased political attention, and institutional innovation.

Given the diversity and complexity of forest management and policy, there is a need to understand and reframe fire science user audiences. In this article, we assess fire science use in the US Northwest (Oregon and Washington) to describe these diverse users and how they perceive, access, and apply fire science. We found that user needs range widely and are sometimes contradictory because of their professions, roles, and relationships, as well as the networks in which they are embedded. Contradictions included desires for both generality and specificity, for social and personal learning, and for science to remain an expert arbiter even as it may increasingly come from nonexpert or potentially partial sources. These factors suggest that fire science delivery should address audiences not only by user typologies but also as a set of dynamic, shifting uses. There is a clear need for intermediary organizations and networks to organize, interpret, and deliver science. These may be most relevant and useful if they offer multiple delivery formats that appeal to the various ways that fire science users learn both as individuals and socially in interactive settings.},

Main findings from this research suggest that (1) in the short term, labor market impacts from large wildfires are positive during the course of a fire, (2) in the long -­‐term, large wildfires lead to greater economic instability by amplifying seasonal variation in employment, (3) local capture of suppression spending helps mediate negative labor market impacts, and (4) local business capacity to capture suppression contracts varies and can be measured by the number of suppression-­‐related vendors active in the county.},

	abstract = {The link between economic growth and natural hazards has long been studied to better understand the effects of natural hazards on local, regional, and country level growth patterns. However, relatively little generalizable research has focused on wildfires, one of the most common forest disturbances in the western United States (US). We examined the effect of large wildfires on employment growth across sectors and time in the western US. We matched wildfire occurrences from 2004 to 2008 and their duration with monthly employment data to identify the effect of wildfire on employment growth. Wildfires generally tended to exhibit positive effects on employment during the periods that suppression efforts were active. However, the overall positive effect masks winners and losers across sectors — such as natural resources and mining and leisure and hospitality, respectively. The overall positive effect then transitioned to a negative drag on local employment growth for a period of up to two years following the wildfire. We explore reasons why some sectors win while others lose and explanations for the lingering effects of a large wildfire on the economy as a whole.},

We matched wildfire data with quarterly employment and earnings growth data to assess the specific effect of wildfire on employment and wage growth in western US counties. Wildfires generally tended to exhibit positive effects on employment and wage growth in the quarter(s) during which suppression efforts were active. However, this effect transitioned to increased economic volatility following a wildfire. The effect of wildfire also varied by the type of county in which wildfire occurred. The amount of suppression costs invested locally had the strongest influence on employment growth, indicating that there may be room for augmenting how local economies experience wildfire either through the development of community capacity or by addressing barriers to local spending in federal wildfire policy.},

	abstract = {The Dry Forest Zone is a region of eastern Oregon and northern California with challenging market conditions and high levels of poverty and unemployment. However, local entrepreneurship, collaboration, and commitment to integrated economic development and natural resource management in the zone are strong. In the past decade, the scope of community-based nonprofits, integrated biomass utilization businesses, and new networks has increased, fostering sustainable forest stewardship at an increasingly regional scale. The geography and climate of the zone support dry forests of pine and mixed conifer with fire regimes that are departed from their historical range of variability. These forests are prone to wildfire hazards and in need of active management to restore more diverse and variable-aged structures. As 68 percent of the land in the zone is public, the communities of this region rely on the economic and ecological productivity of these federal forests. The number of sawmills that once provided high levels of primary processing capacity and employment has shrunk to nine mills in the zone. More forest-related employment is now forestry support work, including activities such as firefighting, pest control, and thinning. Poverty and unemployment have increased, with estimated poverty levels in 2007 of over 15 percent in ten of the fifteen counties. Through the Dry Forest Zone project, we have an opportunity to build on the local strengths of this region and overcome these ecological and socioeconomic challenges.},

In this era of devolution and social-ecological change, there is a growing need for policy approaches that facilitate partnerships and participatory approaches to land management. One unique policy that emphasizes collaboration and large-landscape restoration on US federal forestlands is the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), established in 2009 to accelerate the pace and scale of forest restoration. The policy included novel characteristics such as a decade-long commitment to landscapes and formal requirements for collaboration. This program presented an opportunity to assess how this policy affected collaboration and the factors that led to differential policy implementation. We conducted 89 interviews across all 23 CFLRP projects with internal agency staff and external collaborators on each project. We found that the CFLRP generated a variety of benefits related to collaboration, including increased trust and stronger relationships, increased collaborative partner influence, decreased litigation and conflict, and increased capacity to accomplish work; however, there were also challenges associated with the program, including thetime-intensive nature of collaboration and the lack of industry or contractors. Various local factors affected collaborative outcomes under the policy, including staff turnover and capacity, local leadership, and collaborative history. Successful collaborative outcomes were widespread under the CFLRP, and from this, we draw implications for the broader environmental governance literature about the policy characteristics that facilitate collaboration and the other institutional variables that may require attention in this context.},

	abstract = {To address rapid change and complex environmental management challenges, governance approaches must support collective action across actors and jurisdictions, and planning at appropriate spatial extents to affect ecological processes. Recent changes in U.S. national forest policy incorporate new tools to facilitate collaborative landscape restoration, providing an opportunity to examine the relationship between policy design and governance change. Based on 151 interviews with agency personnel and partners, and a survey of 425 agency staff members, we investigated how two new policy approaches affected the governance of forest restoration and also looked at the other factors that most significantly affected policy implementation. Our findings reveal that, under these policies, multi-year funding commitments to specific landscapes, combined with requirements to work collaboratively, resulted in larger scales of planning, improved relationships, greater leveraged capacity, and numerous innovations compared to the past. A history of collaborative relationships, leadership, and agency capacity were the most significant variables that affected the implementation of policies designed to support collaborative landscape restoration. Our findings suggest that policies that provide focused investment to undertake landscape approaches to restoration, along with specific requirements for interagency and partner collaboration, are yielding positive results and may represent a new era in forest policy in the United States.},

We address this question with a focus on the US Forest Service, which is transitioning to managing for resilience, while operating under a mix of both new and decades-old policies. We conducted qualitative case study research on the Kaibab National Forest in Arizona, USA, via interviews and document analysis. In this context, managing for resilience translated into ensuring that forests experienced frequent, low-severity fires. This endeavor required managers to work through the legacy of fire exclusion and develop institutions to accommodate frequent burning in a new land management plan. In this plan, managers also sought to increase their discretion, but not at the expense of accountability. Collaboration with external stakeholders allowed them to strike this balance between flexibility and accountability and make the intentional institutional changes needed to manage for resilience.},

	abstract = {The concept of resilience has permeated the discourse of many land use and environmental agencies in an attempt to articulate how to develop and implement policies concerned with the social and ecological dimensions of natural disturbances. Several distinct definitions of resilience exist, each with its own concepts, focus and contexts related to land use policy and management. This often makes understanding the inherent objectives of policies and related principles challenging. The United States Forest Service (USFS) is one example where ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding the use of resilience permeates the content of documents in various areas of the agency. The objective of this paper is to investigate how the USFS employs the term resilience as a means to communicate strategies for managing forest lands. We perform a content analysis of 121 USFS documents including budgetary justification reports, research findings (i.e., journal articles, book chapters and technical reports), public releases, and newsletters to analyze both the rise and specific use of the term resilience in the USFS. Our analysis, which is guided by definitions of resilience in the social-ecological systems literature, reveals that the ambiguity surrounding the use of resilience in the academic literature is reflected in the content of USFS documents. However, we also find that often criticized versions of resilience (namely engineering resilience) are minimally employed by the USFS, and instead the agency focuses on the notion of ecological resilience in which natural disturbances are seen as an important component of the landscape. In some cases, the USFS employs notions of social-ecological resilience, however, the extent to which specific components of social-ecological resilience are integrated into management strategies appears minimal. The findings from this study suggest that clarity regarding the type and function of resilience needs to improve in USFS documents, and that the agency should evaluate the existing question in the SES literature of resilience of what to what?},

	abstract = {Native bark beetles and wildfire are among the most prominent natural disturbances in the conifer forests of western North America. Using multiple approaches and scales, researchers have sought to understand how each disturbance may, or may not, influence the subsequent likelihood or severity of the other disturbance. Our objectives were to complement existing research on the linkage of mountain pine beetle and wildfire disturbances by combining large-scale spatial data at variable temporal resolutions to characterize the discrepancy between observed and expected overlap areas of fire and beetle disturbances. Multiple time lags, differing by 1-yr intervals, spanning the 30-yr period 1984-2014 in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon were examined for wildfire following bark beetle epidemics and for beetle epidemics following wildfire. We used existing spatial data sets of wildfires and insect pest disturbances to perform overlay analyses to characterize the two relationships. We also compared years of peak vs. non-peak fires, as well as the influence of several individual, large disturbances. We found a clear association of increased bark beetle epidemic shortly after wildfire. The evidence of an association between increased fire extent and severity following bark beetle epidemics was less straightforward, although it suggested that the nature of the observed patterns varied with fire severity. In some cases, individual disturbance seasons or events were highly influential on the overall trends. Variability in the results highlights the challenges of quantifying landscape-level relationships among disturbance types and supports the existing calls for further analyses with additional ecological variables.

	abstract = {Landscape-scale forest disturbance events have become increasingly common worldwide under the combined influences of climate change and ecosystem modification. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic that swept through North American forests from the late 1990s through the early 2010s was one of the largest such disturbance events on record and triggered shocks to ecological and economic systems. We analyze the policy and governance responses to this event by focusing on three national forests in the state of Colorado and on the agency responsible for their management, the U.S. Forest Service. We found that the event triggered the formation of new hybrid agency/nonagency organizations that contributed both legitimacy and capacity to address the most immediate threats to human safety and infrastructure. Despite the use of a highly networked governance structure, longstanding U.S. Forest Service institutions continued to heavily influence the scope of the response and the means for implementing management activities. We detected relatively limited institutional response at the level of the agency as a whole, even as regional- and local-scale institutions within Colorado showed greater dynamism. Indeed, the changes to agency institutions that were detected were largely consistent with institutional change trajectories already in place prior to the epidemic. Our study points to the importance of institutional persistence and path dependence in limiting the latitude for adaptation to social and environmental shocks.},

	abstract = {The native Mountain Pine Beetle infests numerous native pine species in North America and can cause extensive mortality when populations enter an epidemic state. We used an agent based cellular model of coupled beetle and host tree populations to investigate the effects on long-term population dynamics of modifying three model components, representing factors that land managers have varying degrees of control over: number of host trees, health of host trees, and number of surviving beetle offspring. Within the parameter space, various behavior types emerged in the simulations: population crashes, regular endemic/epidemic cycles, and sporadic cycles. The largest, recurring epidemics occurred in simulations with dense populations of mostly vigorous trees and moderately high beetle offspring production. The fewest epidemics occurred with low beetle reproduction, and low tree population density. With all other factors held constant, reducing the tree population below a threshold reduced the proportion of cells experiencing beetle population epidemics. These results are consistent with field observations of reduced tree losses to beetle epidemics in thinned forest stands. The long-term simulations used in this study provide novel insights not captured by single-epidemic simulations, such as the fact that it was very difficult to maintain endemic populations for long periods, and that epidemics tended to be more erratic at higher tree densities.},

	abstract = {Understanding how institutions respond in the face of environmental or social shocks is a central concern in the study of the adaptive governance of social-ecological systems. This study attempted to determine whether and how the US Congress responded to epidemics of the native mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) in the federal land-dominated intermountain US West, including a ca. 2000–2010 epidemic that far outpaced any prior outbreak on record in terms of area affected. In addition, we categorized the causal narratives represented by MPB legislation and analyzed patterns over time and by political party. We found very limited evidence of specific legislative responses to MPB epidemics; of the 43 MPB-related bills introduced into Congress, only five were passed into law and of these, three had relatively limited scope or application. Our analysis of narratives shows a shift over time from bills that attempted to increase the capacity of government agencies to address MPB impacts toward bills focused on reducing or eliminating procedural and environmental analysis requirements on federal land management agencies and providing new contracting options. Our findings call into question the ability of high-level deliberative bodies to advance institutional reform to address emerging patterns of environmental change.},

	abstract = {Federal policies related to forestry and forest health (specifically, insects and diseases) have the potential to affect management practices, terms of international and interstate trade, and long-term sustainability and conservation. Our objectives were to review existing federal policies, the role of federal agencies in managing forest health, and guidance for future policy efforts. Since the 1940s, various federal policies relevant to forest health have been established, and several US Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies have been empowered to assist with prevention, quarantine, detection, management, and control of insects and diseases. Overall, our review showed that relatively few national policies directly address forest health as a stand-alone objective, as most of them are embedded within forestry bills. Federal funding for forest health issues and the number of personnel dedicated to such issues have declined dramatically for some agencies. Concomitantly, native species continue to gain pestiferous status while non-native species continue to establish and cause impacts in the US. To enhance our ability and capacity to deal with current and future threats, concerted efforts are needed to advocate for both resources and stand-alone policy tools that take seriously the complexity of emerging sustainability challenges in both private and public forestlands.

To date, however, insufficient consideration has been given to wildfire resilience as a process of adaptive governance mediated by institutions at multiple scales. Here we explore the possibilities for addressing this gap through an analysis of wildfire resilience among wildland-urban interface communities in the western region of the United States. We re-engage important but overlooked components of social-ecological system resilience by situating rural communities within their state- to national-level institutional contexts; we then analyze two communities in Nevada and New Mexico in terms of their institutional settings and responses to recent wildfire events. We frame our analysis around the concepts of scale matching, linking within and across scales, and institutional flexibility.},

Private contractors have become increasingly important in providing equipment and services to support agency wildfire suppression needs in the USA. Understanding the capacity of contracted resources for federal agency fire suppression needs is critical for preseason fire planning and response. Using National Resource Ordering and Status System data, we examined Northwest region engine dispatches from 2008 to 2015. The number of times and days engines were out on assignments increased over the study period, and dispatch centres routinely shared engines within and outside their geographic area. However, in 2015, not all of the available engines were recorded as utilised at peak demand during one of the largest fire seasons in the Northwest. This study provides insight into the ways in which fire managers share important resources such as engines and the information they have available to make decisions during an incident, and raises questions about what the right amount of capacity is to be able to respond in extreme fire years.},

Despite this emphasis, it is unclear whether local business capacity is a predictor of local participation in federally managed wildfire response. Drawing on concepts from economic geography, we hypothesize that the local capture of federal contracting during large wildfire suppression events will be greater in counties that have more firms experienced with federal natural resource management contracting. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the contracting patterns of 135 large wildfire suppression efforts and found that local capture of suppression contracting was higher for fires that occurred in counties where there were more vendors involved in federal, non-fire-related contracting. Counties with more diversified economies were also more likely to capture suppression contracting opportunities than counties with more specialized economies. Our findings suggest that the resilient forests and fire-adapted community goals envisioned by the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy can be supported by the development of natural resource management capacity that is nationally decentralized and locally diversified.},

	abstract = {Conservation-based development programs have sought to create economic opportunities for people negatively impacted by biological diversity protection. The USDA Forest Service, for example, developed policies and programs to create contracting opportunities for local communities to restore public lands to replace jobs lost from reduced timber harvest. This article examines 12 years of Forest Service land management contracting in western Oregon, Washington, and northern California to evaluate if contractors located in communities near national forests have been awarded more land management contracts and contract value over time. We find that land management contracting spending has declined dramatically and, once we control for intervening factors, we find that local contractors have received a smaller proportion of land management contracts over time. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Years of drought and decades of aggressive fire exclusion have left North American forests at high risk for catastrophic fires. Forest settings are a magnet for recreation and for rapidly growing residential development–putting an increasing number of citizens and their property into the path of wildfires. To be effective, wildfire risk management must be informed by science–but that requires more than just knowledge about the physical and biological dynamics of fire and forest ecosystems. Social values, socioeconomic factors, demographic trends, institutional arrangements, and human behavior must also be taken into consideration by the agencies and individuals responsible for wildland fire decision making. The first book of its kind to integrate the social science literature on the human dimensions of wildfire, People, Fire, and Forests reviews current studies from this broad, interdisciplinary field and synthesizes them into a rich body of knowledge with practical management implications. Sections in the book cover such topics as public perception of wildfire risk, acceptability of fire management policies, and community impacts of wildfire. Designed to make relevant social science information more available and useful to wildfire risk managers and policy makers, as well as to scholars and students, People, Fire, and Forests explores the theoretical and methodological issues surrounding human interactions with wildfire and describes the practical implications of this research.},
