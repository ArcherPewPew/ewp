	abstract = {Background: Karuk and Yurok tribes in northwestern California, USA, are revitalizing the practice of cultural burning, which is the use of prescribed burns to enhance culturally important species. These cultural burns are critical to the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, and were widespread prior to the establishment of fire exclusion policies. One of the major objectives of cultural burning is to enhance California hazelnut (Corylus cornuta Marsh var. californica) basketry stem production for Karuk and Yurok basketweavers. To evaluate cultural burning as a form of human ecosystem engineering, we monitored hazelnut basketry stem production, qualities, and shrub density in 48 plots (400 m2) within two prescribed and 19 cultural burn sites. Socio-ecological variables that were analyzed included burn frequency, burn season, overstory tree (≥10 cm diameter at breast height) basal area, ungulate browse, and aspect. We also observed basketry stem gathering to compare travel distances, gathering rates, and basketweaver preferences across sites with different fire histories and land tenure. Results: Hazelnut shrubs, one growing season post burn, produced a 13-fold increase in basketry stems compared with shrubs growing at least three seasons post burn (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.0001). Basketry stem production and stem length displayed negative relationships with overstory tree basal area (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) and ungulate browse (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.0001). Plots burned at high frequency (at least three burn events from 1989 to 2019) had 1.86-fold greater hazelnut shrubs than plots experiencing less than three burn events (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.0001), and were all located on the Yurok Reservation where land tenure of indigenous people is comparatively stronger. Basketweavers travelled 3.8-fold greater distance to reach gathering sites burned by wildfires compared with those that were culturally burned (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). At cultural burn sites, wildfire sites, and fire-excluded sites, mean gathering rates were 4.9, 1.6, and 0.5 stems per minute per individual, respectively. Conclusions: Karuk and Yurok cultural fire regimes with high burn frequencies (e.g., three to five years) promote high densities of hazelnut shrubs and increase hazelnut basketry stem production. This improves gathering efficiency and lowers travel costs to support the revitalization of a vital cultural practice. Our findings provide evidence of positive human ecosystem engineering, and show that increasing tribal sovereignty over fire management improves socio-economic well-being while at the same time supports measures of ecosystem structure and function.},

	abstract = {We studied stand development in three distinct forest types in southwestern Oregon using six stands each in uncut and clear-felled old-growth stands and nearby young stands (18 total). Old-growth stands showed a wide range of tree ages ({\textbackslash}textgreater300. years) and low tree densities for several centuries; rapid early growth produced trees with large crowns and diameters, as well as low height-to-diameter ratios. In contrast, young stands established much quicker and at higher tree densities; beyond their initial 20. years, trees had smaller diameters at equivalent ages, slower growth rates, smaller crowns and higher H:D than trees in old-growth stands. Low-intensity disturbance, likely dominated by fire, was common in old-growth stands during their early development. Fire scars showed these stands burned frequently from 1700 to 1900, and low levels of tree recruitment occurred in a complex relationship with fire during this 200. years. There was no evidence of fire, however, in either old-growth or young stands after 1909, and their densities were well above that of 1900; in old-growth stands, 15-25\% of the basal growth occurred from 1950 to 1990, and it appears that they are on a development pathway different from what they experienced from 1700 to 1900. Furthermore, tree recruitment has been limited in both old-growth and young stands since 1950 while biomass and fuels continue to accumulate rapidly. Past stand dynamics can be emulated by prescribed fire and light thinning to reduce risk of loss from severe fire or insects, as well as to partially restore stand conditions that existed prior to fire exclusion. Our results suggest that young stands can be grown to produce high levels of biomass/wood, or their development can be altered to more closely follow that of old-growth stands depending on management objectives. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Rural forest communities in the US Pacific Northwest have seen their economic base disappear with the technological change and reduced timber supply in the forest products industry. Some progress has been made in diversifying local economies, but rural communities are still lagging. Rural communities and workers have a great stake in assuring that future resource jobs provide them with a way to make a living and stay connected to the land base. However, quality jobs providing good compensation, accepted skill standards and career opportunities are not likely to emerge without major intervention and advocacy. This paper examines one attempt to create quality resource jobs in the field of ecosystem management, the Ecosystem Workforce Project (EWP). EWP is a three-year action research project in Western Oregon that provides community-based training in ecosystem management to rural workers. I first explore the multiple obstacles to implementing a quality job path to ecosystem management, including the structure and behavior of the forestry services industry, the policies and organizational culture of the public land management agencies (the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management), and the historic lack of community voice in resource management decisions. I then describe the EWP. And finally I draw lessons from the EWP experience for using community-based workforce development projects as a pathway towards systematic change.},

	abstract = {Three species of small-diameter logs from the Klamath/Siskiyou Mountains and the Cascade Range in southwest Oregon were tested for their potential for value-added structural applications. The logs were tested in bending and compression parallel to the grain. Strength and stiffness values were correlated to possible nondestructive evaluation grading parameters and compared to values derived from published values based on tests of small-diameter clear wood of the test species. For the test sample, specific gravity and static bending modulus of elasticity were good indicators of strength. Growth rate, however, was poorly correlated to specific gravity, strength, and stiffness. The results suggest that the conventionally derived design values based on published small clear strength values are appropriate for bending but nonconservative for axial compressive strength. At present, established round timber specifications, modified to place limits on the presence of crown wood, would be sufficient for selection of small-diameter structural timbers. If a more tightly controlled strength limit is desirable for a specific application, static modulus of elasticity appears to be the most reliable indicator of strength of small-diameter logs.},

This paper seeks to extend this explanation by considering the constraining role of federal legislation, institutional management and commercial resource exploitation that limited opportunities for Hispano/environmental collaborative challenges to federal resource management arrangements. I analyze the foundations of sustained yield forestry on the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico though a focus on the legal construction of sustained yield policies and the practices of implementing sustained yield on the Vallecitos Federal Sustained Yield Unit, a special timber production sub-unit of the Carson. The paper illustrates how the deployment of sustained yield forestry in New Mexico produced not only conditions of production favorable to commercial timber operators, but also established a complex and contradictory regulatory environment that effectively constrained collaborative efforts between environmentalists and small-scale loggers in their efforts to construct alternative futures for resource management in the region. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The analyses focus not only on how societies can organize, but on how they do organize to overcome such daunting obstacles in the Netherlands, the Northwest United States, Costa Rica, Madagascar, Senegal, and the European Union. The writers focus particularly upon the special problem embedded in the sustainability paradigm, that of organizing governance across scales―that is to say, across and between geographic, political, ecological, or other social levels in a sustainable regime. In recent years the scale problem has emerged as a major and enlarging concern, as international efforts proliferate to implement various sorts of sustainability policies. The analyses focus not only on how societies can organize, but on how they do organize to overcome such daunting obstacles. The analyses place considerable emphasis upon the history and lessons to be learned from ongoing efforts to achieve such governance in several diverse international settings including the Netherlands, the Northwest United States, Costa Rica, Madagascar, Senegal, and the European Union.},

At the urging of citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and industry, government officials at all levels have experimented with collaboration. Yet questions remain about the roles that governments play in collaboration–whether they are constructive and support collaboration, or introduce barriers. This thoughtful book analyzes a series of cases to understand how collaborative processes work and whether government can be an equal partner even as government agencies often formally control decision making and are held accountable for the outcomes. Looking at examples where government has led, encouraged, or followed in collaboration, the authors assess how governmental actors and institutions affected the way issues were defined, the resources available for collaboration, and the organizational processes and structures that were established. Cases include collaborative efforts to manage watersheds, rivers, estuaries, farmland, endangered species habitats, and forests. The authors develop a new theoretical framework and demonstrate that government left a heavy imprint in each of the efforts. The work concludes by discussing the choices and challenges faced by governmental institutions and actors as they try to realize the potential of collaborative environmental management. © 2004 by Resources for the Future.

@techreport{moseley_procurement_2006,
	title = {Procurement {Contracting} in the {Affected} {Counties} of the {Northwest} {Forest} {Plan}: 12 years of {Change}},
	abstract = {As part of the 10-year socioeconomic monitoring of the Northwest Forest Plan, this report evaluates changes in Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) procurement contracting between 1990 and 2002 by asking, (1) How much and what kind of work did the Forest Service and BLM contract during this period, and (2) who received economic benefits from this procurement contracting? Procurement contracting is a particular focus of the socioeconomic monitoring because one expectation of the Northwest Forest Plan was that the Forest Service and BLM would create high-skill, high-wage private sector jobs in public land restoration through contracting to partially offset job losses in timber production, harvesting, and processing. This report finds that, to the contrary, the Forest Service reduced its contracting of land management activities on national forests in the Northwest Forest Plan area from a high of \$103 million in 1991 to a low of \$33 million in 2002. By contrast, BLM spending was fairly constant at just under \$20 million annually. Both the Forest Service and the BLM changed the type of activities that they contracted, shifting from activities associated with intensive forest management such as tree planting in clearcuts to activities associated with ecosystem management. Contractors located near national forests and BLM lands and rural communities captured a similar proportion of contracts in both the earlier and later parts of the study period. However, the significant decline in Forest Service contract spending resulted in considerable decline in the amount of money flowing to rural communities through contracting. Thus, it is unlikely that federal land management contracting created a net increase in jobs to replace jobs lost in mills and logging operations in public lands communities.},

It finds that Hispanics are a disproportionately large part of the workforce, particularly the labor-intensive workforce, and are more likely than whites to work seasonally, away from home, and work for companies that do not offer health insurance.

	abstract = {Years of drought and decades of aggressive fire exclusion have left North American forests at high risk for catastrophic fires. Forest settings are a magnet for recreation and for rapidly growing residential development–putting an increasing number of citizens and their property into the path of wildfires. To be effective, wildfire risk management must be informed by science–but that requires more than just knowledge about the physical and biological dynamics of fire and forest ecosystems. Social values, socioeconomic factors, demographic trends, institutional arrangements, and human behavior must also be taken into consideration by the agencies and individuals responsible for wildland fire decision making. The first book of its kind to integrate the social science literature on the human dimensions of wildfire, People, Fire, and Forests reviews current studies from this broad, interdisciplinary field and synthesizes them into a rich body of knowledge with practical management implications. Sections in the book cover such topics as public perception of wildfire risk, acceptability of fire management policies, and community impacts of wildfire. Designed to make relevant social science information more available and useful to wildfire risk managers and policy makers, as well as to scholars and students, People, Fire, and Forests explores the theoretical and methodological issues surrounding human interactions with wildfire and describes the practical implications of this research.},

We found that the effects of declining timber harvests were variable and depended on the importance of the timber sector in a community in the late 1980s, the extent to which federal timber supported that sector, and the degree to which local residents depended on US Forest Service jobs. In addition, we found that other goods, services, and opportunities associated with federal lands declined under the Plan, further affecting communities by curtailing private and public sector business and employment opportunities. Community effects also depended on the unique circumstances of a community. A socioeconomic well-being index we developed indicated that overall, communities within five miles of a federal forest were not doing as well as communities farther away.},

We explore how the Plan affected the flow of socioeconomic benefits associated with the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, such as the production of forest commodities and forest-based recreation, agency jobs, procurement contract work for ecosystem management activities, grants for community economic assistance, payments to county governments, and opportunities for collaborative forest management. The greatest socioeconomic change stemming from the national forest during the study period was the sharp decline in timber harvest activities, a change that had been underway prior to the Plan. This decline not only affected timber industry jobs in local communities, but also resulted in declining agency budgets and staff reductions. Communities' responses differed. Communities with greater economic diversity were able to absorb the changes in forest management, whereas communities more heavily dependent on timber experienced an additional destabilizing effect.},

	abstract = {The Dry Forest Zone is a region of eastern Oregon and northern California with challenging market conditions and high levels of poverty and unemployment. However, local entrepreneurship, collaboration, and commitment to integrated economic development and natural resource management in the zone are strong. In the past decade, the scope of community-based nonprofits, integrated biomass utilization businesses, and new networks has increased, fostering sustainable forest stewardship at an increasingly regional scale. The geography and climate of the zone support dry forests of pine and mixed conifer with fire regimes that are departed from their historical range of variability. These forests are prone to wildfire hazards and in need of active management to restore more diverse and variable-aged structures. As 68 percent of the land in the zone is public, the communities of this region rely on the economic and ecological productivity of these federal forests. The number of sawmills that once provided high levels of primary processing capacity and employment has shrunk to nine mills in the zone. More forest-related employment is now forestry support work, including activities such as firefighting, pest control, and thinning. Poverty and unemployment have increased, with estimated poverty levels in 2007 of over 15 percent in ten of the fifteen counties. Through the Dry Forest Zone project, we have an opportunity to build on the local strengths of this region and overcome these ecological and socioeconomic challenges.},

This research classifies 370 state policies from across the United States that provides incentives for forest biomass utilization. We compare those policies by types of incentives relative to the supply chain and geographic clustering. We then develop a framework for policy evaluation building on the supply chain steps, which can be used to assess intended and unintended consequences of policy interactions. These findings may inform policy development and identify synergies at different steps in the supply chain to enhance forest biomass utilization.},

This report offers four strategies for collaboration based on the experiences of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Both agencies have authorities, called “stewardship contracting,” which they used to foster collaboration at the front line in their agencies. Although stewardship contracting is a set of authorities particular to the U.S. Forest Service and BLM, much of the collaboration that these two agencies have undertaken around stewardship contracting did not require any special authority. The two agencies have used stewardship contracting as a vehicle to develop a new direction and support for collaborative approaches to federal land management.},

Social maps could be used to inform local planning, such as comprehensive plans, siting new development, and prioritizing locations for future recreation, conservation, and water projects. KEY SURVEY FINDINGS We surveyed residents of Albany, Carbon, and Sweewater counties in 2010. Most participants reported that fish and wildlife habitat, availability of water, and open spaces and scenic views are extremely or very important to them. Water is very important to people for agriculture and recreation. Most participants were very concerned about the possibility of future drought, but very few participants felt that their communities are prepared for future droughts. Many participants perceive that wind energy development may enhance the economic sustainability of family farms and ranches, but there was some concern about the potential negative effects of wind developments on wildlife populations and access to some lands for recreation.},

Findings indicate that mitigation activities are closely correlated with biophysical risk to wildfire, but socially vulnerable communities are less likely to participate even when exposed to high wildfire risk. This finding suggests a need for a more strategic and equitable distribution of federal resources to mitigate wildfire risk.},

Findings indicate that the conventional wisdoms were reasonably accurate although the degree to which each impeded progress varied. Their interconnectedness also varied depending on local conditions. Supply guarantees, industry presence, transportation, and the value of the biomass were limiting factors to use, whereas agency budgets and staffing, environmental concerns, and partnerships more aggravated the problem than impeded progress.

The pilot study reported in this article sought to understand family forest owner willingness to participate in carbon sequestration projects by asking professional foresters who are members of the Forest Guild what they believed would influence family forest owner willingness to participate in sequestration projects and how projects could be designed to foster participation. These foresters identified profitability, compliance difficulties, immaturity of carbon markets, property rights infringements, moral objections to carbon markets, and forester hesitation in recommending participation as the principal barriers to participation. They suggested that barriers could be overcome by increasing profitability, creating low cost and low hassle compliance systems, addressing landowner property rights concerns, and implementing education campaigns aimed at increasing forester knowledge of carbon markets and sequestration projects.},

We examined the effect of large wildfires on employment growth across sectors and time in the western US. We matched wildfire occurrences from 2004 to 2008 and their duration with monthly employment data to identify the effect of wildfire on employment growth. Wildfires generally tended to exhibit positive effects on employment during the periods that suppression efforts were active. However, the overall positive effect masks winners and losers across sectors — such as natural resources and mining and leisure and hospitality, respectively. The overall positive effect then transitioned to a negative drag on local employment growth for a period of up to two years following the wildfire. We explore reasons why some sectors win while others lose and explanations for the lingering effects of a large wildfire on the economy as a whole.},

	abstract = {Globally, ecological restoration activities are increasing in response to environmental, economic, and cultural trends that value ecological capital for the services provided by healthy functioning ecosystems. To ensure continued investment in ecological restoration, practitioners and researchers need to identify links to the benefits accrued to society from ecological restoration practice and policy. Nonetheless, a recent review of published literature on ecological restoration concludes that the policy and socioeconomic contributions of ecological restoration are often ignored. To help fill this gap, we describe the policy context of a sustained program of forest and watershed restoration in Oregon, U.S.A. and report on three related studies on the market structure and resulting economic impacts of this program of work in Oregon. The first study examines the experiences of watershed councils (n = 52) in mobilizing human resources for ecological restoration. The second focuses on the businesses and firms (n = 190) that participate in Oregon's restoration economy. The third analyzes the employment and economic impacts from a sample of Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board restoration grants (n = 99). We found that the sustained program of restoration work in Oregon has conferred significant benefits to Oregon's economy. These impacts largely accrue to rural areas in need of economic development opportunities due to declines in traditional resource management activities. In addition to approximately 16 jobs supported per million dollars invested in ecological restoration, a sustained investment in restoration has created both new local organizational capacity in watershed councils and other community‐based partners and business opportunities especially in rural Oregon.},

	abstract = {The Joint Fire Science Program has initiated regional consortia to deliver science to managers and other natural resource stakeholders. Given the diversity and complexity of forest management and policy, there is a need to understand and reframe fire science user audiences. In this article, we assess fire science use in the US Northwest (Oregon and Washington) to describe these diverse users and how they perceive, access, and apply fire science. We found that user needs range widely and are sometimes contradictory because of their professions, roles, and relationships, as well as the networks in which they are embedded. Contradictions included desires for both generality and specificity, for social and personal learning, and for science to remain an expert arbiter even as it may increasingly come from nonexpert or potentially partial sources. These factors suggest that fire science delivery should address audiences not only by user typologies but also as a set of dynamic, shifting uses. There is a clear need for intermediary organizations and networks to organize, interpret, and deliver science. These may be most relevant and useful if they offer multiple delivery formats that appeal to the various ways that fire science users learn both as individuals and socially in interactive settings.},

However, appropriations for hazardous fuels reduction still lag behind wildfire suppression spending. Offsetting fuels treatment costs through biomass utilization or by using innovative administrative mechanisms such as stewardship contracting are two approaches to stretching appropriated dollars further across the landscape. We use fuels treatment data (n = 8,451 locations) to ask how wood- processing infrastructure influences where and how much hazardous fuels treatments, biomass utilization, and stewardship contracting occur on national forests in Oregon and Washington. We found that national forest ranger districts that are relatively close in proximity to sawmills or biomass facilities treated more overall ha and more wildland-urban interface ha and used stewardship contracting on more ha than ranger districts further away and that there was a threshold distance for these effects (40 minutes). We also found that proximity to sawmills and biomass facilities influenced the location and extent of hazardous fuels treatments that incorporated biomass utilization or were administered through a stewardship contract. Our analysis suggests that to be effective at offsetting some of the costs of hazardous fuels reduction and treat a greater extent of the landscape, policy strategies may need to focus on supporting a network of wood-processing facilities that is distributed across forest-based communities.},

	abstract = {Payments for ecosystems services (PES) is increasingly recognized as a way to protect and enhance ecosystems by linking beneficiaries and providers through various payment options and voluntary supply arrangements. The concept of the local marketplace, which uses a non-commodity, expanded view of the PES marketplace, has significant potential for non-fungible PES such as watershed services. Water utilities can be key drivers in development of such marketplaces as they are prominent actors in communities and watersheds, and they are typically strategically situated between PES purchasers and potential providers. This article explores the potential for local PES marketplaces and the role of water utilities in their development through a case study of the Voluntary Incentives Program (VIP), a PES initiative under development by the Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB) in Eugene, Oregon. Using a mixed method research approach to explore institutional and social acceptability issues, findings suggest strong support for the program, and for EWEB's role among providers and purchasers. Implications include, among other things, the significant potential for water utilities to act as local marketplace drivers and the importance of carefully designing local PES programs to meet local marketplace needs and support.},

Despite its implied reconciliation of commodity production and environmental protection, this concept remains contested terrain, masking tensions over land use practices and understandings of human–nature relations. Here we draw on a case study of landownership and land use change in remote, rural Wallowa County, Oregon to explore how working landscapes are envisioned and enacted by various actors. The arrival of landowning amenity migrants, many of whom actively endorsed a working landscape vision, resulted in subtle but significant transformations in land use practices and altered opportunities for local producers. The working landscape ideal, while replete with tensions and contradictions, nevertheless functioned as an important alternative vision to the rural gentrification characteristic of other scenic Western environs.},

Main findings from this research suggest that (1) in the short term, labor market impacts from large wildfires are positive during the course of a fire, (2) in the long -­‐term, large wildfires lead to greater economic instability by amplifying seasonal variation in employment, (3) local capture of suppression spending helps mediate negative labor market impacts, and (4) local business capacity to capture suppression contracts varies and can be measured by the number of suppression-­‐related vendors active in the county.},

In addition, we categorized the causal narratives represented by MPB legislation and analyzed patterns over time and by political party. We found very limited evidence of specific legislative responses to MPB epidemics; of the 43 MPB-related bills introduced into Congress, only five were passed into law and of these, three had relatively limited scope or application. Our analysis of narratives shows a shift over time from bills that attempted to increase the capacity of government agencies to address MPB impacts toward bills focused on reducing or eliminating procedural and environmental analysis requirements on federal land management agencies and providing new contracting options. Our findings call into question the ability of high-level deliberative bodies to advance institutional reform to address emerging patterns of environmental change.},

The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic that swept through North American forests from the late 1990s through the early 2010s was one of the largest such disturbance events on record and triggered shocks to ecological and economic systems. We analyze the policy and governance responses to this event by focusing on three national forests in the state of Colorado and on the agency responsible for their management, the U.S. Forest Service. We found that the event triggered the formation of new hybrid agency/nonagency organizations that contributed both legitimacy and capacity to address the most immediate threats to human safety and infrastructure. Despite the use of a highly networked governance structure, longstanding U.S. Forest Service institutions continued to heavily influence the scope of the response and the means for implementing management activities. We detected relatively limited institutional response at the level of the agency as a whole, even as regional- and local-scale institutions within Colorado showed greater dynamism. Indeed, the changes to agency institutions that were detected were largely consistent with institutional change trajectories already in place prior to the epidemic. Our study points to the importance of institutional persistence and path dependence in limiting the latitude for adaptation to social and environmental shocks.},

	abstract = {This paper examines micro-processes of institutionalization, using the case of stewardship contracting within the US Forest Service. Our basic premise is that, until a new policy becomes an everyday practice among local actors, it will not become institutionalized at the macro-scale. We find that micro-processes of institutionalization are driven by a mixture of large-scale institutional dynamics and how frontline decision-makers understand and interpret these dynamics, given the local social and ecological context in which they operate. For example, this paper suggests that a new policy may become institutionalized when it is understood to solve problems that old institutions at once create and demand to be solved. Agency actors cannot be conceptualized as untethered from the institutions in which they operate. Yet, within larger institutional dynamics, field personnel make key choices about whether to adopt a new policy, making them important players in the micro-processes of policy institutionalization. The interplay of actors and institutions turns agencies, such as the Forest Service, into complex systems that cannot be understood as artifacts of their own history or as a sum of the decisions of individual actors. This dynamic also implies that macro-level institutional change will be uneven, incomplete, and gradual, mirroring uneven, contingent micro-level processes.},

We compare working conditions between fire suppression and nonsuppression forest work across Latino and non-Latino populations in Oregon. We find that although both groups share some similar conditions, Latino workers often faced poorer conditions, including disrespectful treatment, uncompensated injuries, risk of being blackballed if they complained, and little opportunity for advancement. However, there were some important job quality improvements for Latinos in fire suppression, including compensation for travel and training. Differences in contracting market structure and federal oversight between fire suppression and other forest work may contribute to improved job quality. This suggests the potential for improving conditions by focusing on improving contracting markets and oversight.},

We find that intermediaries were working between buyers and sellers in each case to set conditions for transactions and undertake the mechanics of implementation. These findings align with existing conceptualizations of intermediaries as crucial links in PES arrangements, but also suggest that intermediaries for market based PES arrangements are not always facilitators or neutral nongovernmental actors; they may actually be from the private sector and drive the process by serving as buyers.

Socio-political responses to this event in many geographies included the emergence of local to regional hybrid networks that provided direction and resources for responding to the disturbance event. In this study, we analyze the ability of governance networks to adapt in the face of the insect outbreak across four regional geographies: The Black Hills region of South Dakota and Wyoming; northern Colorado; northeastern Washington; and southwestern Montana. Specifically, we ask what factors accounted for divergent governance responses in the four cases and to what extent the emergent governance dynamics in each case facilitated lasting, long-term adaptation. Our results highlight governance trajectories as products of their respective histories and of feedback cycles among socio-political, institutional, and technological variables. By analyzing the origin, characteristics, and persistence of institutional change, this research contributes a comparative perspective on the adaptive potential of networks as functions of influences from multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Collaborative governance and landscape approaches have become a more prevalent in public land management in the United States in the face of increasing ecological and societal complexity and decreasing government resources and capacity. In this era of devolution and social-ecological change, there is a growing need for policy approaches that facilitate partnerships and participatory approaches to land management. One unique policy that emphasizes collaboration and large-landscape restoration on US federal forestlands is the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), established in 2009 to accelerate the pace and scale of forest restoration. The policy included novel characteristics such as a decade-long commitment to landscapes and formal requirements for collaboration. This program presented an opportunity to assess how this policy affected collaboration and the factors that led to differential policy implementation. We conducted 89 interviews across all 23 CFLRP projects with internal agency staff and external collaborators on each project. We found that the CFLRP generated a variety of benefits related to collaboration, including increased trust and stronger relationships, increased collaborative partner influence, decreased litigation and conflict, and increased capacity to accomplish work; however, there were also challenges associated with the program, including thetime-intensive nature of collaboration and the lack of industry or contractors. Various local factors affected collaborative outcomes under the policy, including staff turnover and capacity, local leadership, and collaborative history. Successful collaborative outcomes were widespread under the CFLRP, and from this, we draw implications for the broader environmental governance literature about the policy characteristics that facilitate collaboration and the other institutional variables that may require attention in this context.},

	abstract = {To address rapid change and complex environmental management challenges, governance approaches must support collective action across actors and jurisdictions, and planning at appropriate spatial extents to affect ecological processes. Recent changes in U.S. national forest policy incorporate new tools to facilitate collaborative landscape restoration, providing an opportunity to examine the relationship between policy design and governance change. Based on 151 interviews with agency personnel and partners, and a survey of 425 agency staff members, we investigated how two new policy approaches affected the governance of forest restoration and also looked at the other factors that most significantly affected policy implementation. Our findings reveal that, under these policies, multi-year funding commitments to specific landscapes, combined with requirements to work collaboratively, resulted in larger scales of planning, improved relationships, greater leveraged capacity, and numerous innovations compared to the past. A history of collaborative relationships, leadership, and agency capacity were the most significant variables that affected the implementation of policies designed to support collaborative landscape restoration. Our findings suggest that policies that provide focused investment to undertake landscape approaches to restoration, along with specific requirements for interagency and partner collaboration, are yielding positive results and may represent a new era in forest policy in the United States.},

	abstract = {The concept of resilience has permeated the discourse of many land use and environmental agencies in an attempt to articulate how to develop and implement policies concerned with the social and ecological dimensions of natural disturbances. Several distinct definitions of resilience exist, each with its own concepts, focus and contexts related to land use policy and management. This often makes understanding the inherent objectives of policies and related principles challenging. The United States Forest Service (USFS) is one example where ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding the use of resilience permeates the content of documents in various areas of the agency. The objective of this paper is to investigate how the USFS employs the term resilience as a means to communicate strategies for managing forest lands. We perform a content analysis of 121 USFS documents including budgetary justification reports, research findings (i.e., journal articles, book chapters and technical reports), public releases, and newsletters to analyze both the rise and specific use of the term resilience in the USFS. Our analysis, which is guided by definitions of resilience in the social-ecological systems literature, reveals that the ambiguity surrounding the use of resilience in the academic literature is reflected in the content of USFS documents. However, we also find that often criticized versions of resilience (namely engineering resilience) are minimally employed by the USFS, and instead the agency focuses on the notion of ecological resilience in which natural disturbances are seen as an important component of the landscape. In some cases, the USFS employs notions of social-ecological resilience, however, the extent to which specific components of social-ecological resilience are integrated into management strategies appears minimal. The findings from this study suggest that clarity regarding the type and function of resilience needs to improve in USFS documents, and that the agency should evaluate the existing question in the SES literature of resilience of what to what?},

	abstract = {Native bark beetles and wildfire are among the most prominent natural disturbances in the conifer forests of western North America. Using multiple approaches and scales, researchers have sought to understand how each disturbance may, or may not, influence the subsequent likelihood or severity of the other disturbance. Our objectives were to complement existing research on the linkage of mountain pine beetle and wildfire disturbances by combining large-scale spatial data at variable temporal resolutions to characterize the discrepancy between observed and expected overlap areas of fire and beetle disturbances. Multiple time lags, differing by 1-yr intervals, spanning the 30-yr period 1984-2014 in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon were examined for wildfire following bark beetle epidemics and for beetle epidemics following wildfire. We used existing spatial data sets of wildfires and insect pest disturbances to perform overlay analyses to characterize the two relationships. We also compared years of peak vs. non-peak fires, as well as the influence of several individual, large disturbances. We found a clear association of increased bark beetle epidemic shortly after wildfire. The evidence of an association between increased fire extent and severity following bark beetle epidemics was less straightforward, although it suggested that the nature of the observed patterns varied with fire severity. In some cases, individual disturbance seasons or events were highly influential on the overall trends. Variability in the results highlights the challenges of quantifying landscape-level relationships among disturbance types and supports the existing calls for further analyses with additional ecological variables.

	abstract = {The native Mountain Pine Beetle infests numerous native pine species in North America and can cause extensive mortality when populations enter an epidemic state. We used an agent based cellular model of coupled beetle and host tree populations to investigate the effects on long-term population dynamics of modifying three model components, representing factors that land managers have varying degrees of control over: number of host trees, health of host trees, and number of surviving beetle offspring. Within the parameter space, various behavior types emerged in the simulations: population crashes, regular endemic/epidemic cycles, and sporadic cycles. The largest, recurring epidemics occurred in simulations with dense populations of mostly vigorous trees and moderately high beetle offspring production. The fewest epidemics occurred with low beetle reproduction, and low tree population density. With all other factors held constant, reducing the tree population below a threshold reduced the proportion of cells experiencing beetle population epidemics. These results are consistent with field observations of reduced tree losses to beetle epidemics in thinned forest stands. The long-term simulations used in this study provide novel insights not captured by single-epidemic simulations, such as the fact that it was very difficult to maintain endemic populations for long periods, and that epidemics tended to be more erratic at higher tree densities.},

Our objectives were to review existing federal policies, the role of federal agencies in managing forest health, and guidance for future policy efforts. Since the 1940s, various federal policies relevant to forest health have been established, and several US Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies have been empowered to assist with prevention, quarantine, detection, management, and control of insects and diseases. Overall, our review showed that relatively few national policies directly address forest health as a stand-alone objective, as most of them are embedded within forestry bills. Federal funding for forest health issues and the number of personnel dedicated to such issues have declined dramatically for some agencies. Concomitantly, native species continue to gain pestiferous status while non-native species continue to establish and cause impacts in the US. To enhance our ability and capacity to deal with current and future threats, concerted efforts are needed to advocate for both resources and stand-alone policy tools that take seriously the complexity of emerging sustainability challenges in both private and public forestlands.

Here we explore the possibilities for addressing this gap through an analysis of wildfire resilience among wildland-urban interface communities in the western region of the United States.

We frame our analysis around the concepts of scale matching, linking within and across scales, and institutional flexibility.},

Private contractors have become increasingly important in providing equipment and services to support agency wildfire suppression needs in the USA. Understanding the capacity of contracted resources for federal agency fire suppression needs is critical for preseason fire planning and response. Using National Resource Ordering and Status System data, we examined Northwest region engine dispatches from 2008 to 2015. The number of times and days engines were out on assignments increased over the study period, and dispatch centres routinely shared engines within and outside their geographic area. However, in 2015, not all of the available engines were recorded as utilised at peak demand during one of the largest fire seasons in the Northwest. This study provides insight into the ways in which fire managers share important resources such as engines and the information they have available to make decisions during an incident, and raises questions about what the right amount of capacity is to be able to respond in extreme fire years.},

Despite this emphasis, it is unclear whether local business capacity is a predictor of local participation in federally managed wildfire response. Drawing on concepts from economic geography, we hypothesize that the local capture of federal contracting during large wildfire suppression events will be greater in counties that have more firms experienced with federal natural resource management contracting. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the contracting patterns of 135 large wildfire suppression efforts and found that local capture of suppression contracting was higher for fires that occurred in counties where there were more vendors involved in federal, non-fire-related contracting. Counties with more diversified economies were also more likely to capture suppression contracting opportunities than counties with more specialized economies. Our findings suggest that the resilient forests and fire-adapted community goals envisioned by the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy can be supported by the development of natural resource management capacity that is nationally decentralized and locally diversified.},
